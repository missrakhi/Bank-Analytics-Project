### Loan Amounts and Payments: 
The total loan amount issued is ₹44,56,02,650, and the total payment received is ₹48,27,04,394. This suggests that the bank has received more in payments than the original loan amounts, which could include principal, interest, and any fees.

### Purposes:

### Total Payments and Installments: 
Some clients have made total payments that are higher than their respective loan amounts, which suggests that these loans might include interest and other fees. clients having over 250 installments, indicating potentially longer loan terms or smaller periodic payments.
